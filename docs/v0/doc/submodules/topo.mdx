## `class` Edge

> `Edge` is a class that represents an decentralized communication in a graph.

Suppose that there are $n$ workers participating in the communication. Denote the weights as $w_1,\cdots, w_n$, and the corresponding data (parameters) as $p_1, \cdots, p_n$.

Then the results of the communication on the $i$-th worker will be:

```math
\hat{p}_i = w_i p_i + \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{j\in[n]\backslash \{i\}} (1 - w_j) p_j
```
where $w_i$ indicates the weight of kept data of the $i$-th worker.

### Constructor

:::warning Arguments

- **ranks** (*List[int]*) - The ranks of the nodes that the edge connects.
- **weight** (*List[float]*) - The weight of the edge.
- **group** (*ProcessGroup, optional*) - The process group that the communication will use, which will be handled and initialized by other utility class. Defaults to None.

## `class` Topology

> Base class for the topology of the decentralized communication graph.

To define a new topology, it needs to override the `_get_topo_edges` method to return the edges of the graph.

### Private attributes \{#topo-private-attr\}

:::warning Attributes

- **self._world_size** (*int*) - The total number of workers.
- **self._rank** (*int*) - The rank of the current worker (in the range of `0` to `self._world_size-1`)
- **self._local_world_size** (*int*) - The number of workers in the local node (assumed to be equal accorss all nodes).
- **self._n_nodes** (*int*) - The number of nodes in the graph (`= self._world_size // self._local_world_size`).

## `class` TopologyReg

### Class methods

#### `func` register

> Decorator to register the topology class.

Usage: Create a new topology class and register it with the decorator. It could make use of the [private attribute](#topo-private-attr) of the base class.

```python
@TopologyReg.register(<topo_name>)
class ExampleTopology(Topology):
    def _get_topo_edges(self) -> List[List[Edge]]:
        ...
```

:::danger Note

Currently, the graph needs to fulfill the following properties:
- Every worker should participate in one and only one communication in each iteration (there is a function in the base class to check this property).
- The weights of the edges should be non-negative and equal to avoid divergence.

## `class` CompleteTopology

> Complete topology where every worker (logically) communicates with every other worker, and the weights are all $1/N$.

## `class` RingTopology

> One-peer ring topology where $2k$-th worker communicates with $(2k+1)$-th worker in odd iterations and $2k$-th worker communicates with $(2k-1)$-th worker in even iterations.
> <br/> The weights are all $1/2$.

## `class` OnePeerExpTopology

> One-peer exponential graph described in the paper ["Exponential Graph is Provably Efficient for Decentralized Deep Training"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13363).
> <br/> The weights are all $1/2$.

## `class` ExpRingTopology

> Alternating exponential ring graph, which is similar to the one-peer exponential graph but better utilizing the fast intra-node connections.
